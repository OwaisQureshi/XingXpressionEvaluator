XingXpressionEvaluator
======================

Short discription
---------------
A C# Class Library for Math Expression Evalaution

The Intent
------------
In our organization there was a need to replace muParser (Which is an excellent math library) which was being 
used in our ASP.NET application so there was a need for simple Math expression evaluator which can calculate simple
Arithmetic expression ,so I made it to work on Addition ,Subtraction ,Multiplication ,Divsion and Power.


Why It's on github
--------------
Download it or clone it do whatever you want to do with it, but do let me know of any improvement which can be made to existing source code ,some considerations are for Object-Oriented Design ,Naming Convention and coding practices and 
bugs ofcourse :)
