Short discription
---------------
A C# Class Library for Math Expression Evalaution

The Intent
------------
In our organization there was a need to replace muParser (Which is an excellent and math library) which was being 
used in our ASP.NET application so there was a need for simple Math expression evaluator which can calculate simple
Arithmetic expression ,so I made it to work on Addition ,Subtraction ,Multiplication ,Divsion and Power.
